# Text extractraction from ppt 
<p> This script will work to catch all the ppt files of a folder and extract text from text box.</br> 
Then it will create excel file for every ppt file. And, paste texts extracted from from ppt file along the row and column </p> 

<p> I have used python `python-pptx` library. `python-pptx` works better with `Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.6` version. </br>

You can create a new environment in anacoda and install python 3.6
